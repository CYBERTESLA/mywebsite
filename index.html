  <h1>Hey I'm Vinay, Welcome to my corner of the Internet.</h1>
  <p>Ok so, I officially don't know what I'm doing.🥴</p>
  <p>But <a href="https://austinkleon.com">Austin Kleon</a> said <em>"Talk about the things you love"</em>🥲</p>
  <p>In <a href="https://austinkleon.com/show-your-work/">his book</a> "Show your Work"</p>

  <p>So I'm just gonna yap about things I'm obsessed with.</p>
  <p>Including this book, My Favourite Authors, My Favourite Creators, Websites, Tools. Blah Blah🙃</p>

  <p>And I'll be learning how to make this website better. And add content to it.</p>
  <p>These are baby steps🥰</p>

  <h2>Why did I build this website?</h2>
  <p>I've wanted to build a website for a while now.</p>
  <p>One of my inspirations was Austin Kleon's book: Show Your Work</p>
  <p>This page specifically. It says exactly the thing that was holding me back -- Registering a domain.</p>
  <p>You can read it if you want:</p>


  <div class="container">
    <div class="image1">
      <img src="images/showyourworkpg67.jpg" title="Page 67 from Show Your Work" width="500" alt="Quote Image from 'Show Your Work'">
    </div>
    <div class="image2">
      <img src="images/ghost_bow.png" alt="Bow ghost" class="mascot2" width="250">
    </div>
  </div>
    
  <div class="Inspirations">
    <p>I won’t be posting very often because I’m learning stuff.</p>

      <p>How to write. What to write. Finding topics. Researching about those topics. Fact Checking. Etc.</p>
      
      <p>Also, I would be learning more than I teach, as the stoic quote goes: 
        <p class="quote">“We have two ears and one mouth so that we can listen twice as much as we speak.” <br>
          -Epictetus
        </p>
      <p>Well, Probably more than twice for me but… you get the point.
