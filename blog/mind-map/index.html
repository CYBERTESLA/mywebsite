    <h1 class="heading">Making a Map of your mind</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>Ok so, I recently learned a technique from <a href="https://austinkleon.com">Austin Kleon</a>. Itâ€™s kind of a journaling method. Itâ€™s called a <b>Mind Map</b>. And it's Great!</p>
    <p>What you do is, you start at the middle of a page. You take your current obsession, or maybe just a thing youâ€™re thinking about right now and write it down. Put a circle around it.</p>
    <p>Then wonder what it reminds you of. Write it down next to that, put a circle or a box around that, and connect the two. Anything that comes to your mind, a personâ€™s name, a topic, a subject, a thing that you worry about, anything. Continue doing this until the page is full.</p>
    <div>
        <img src="Mind_map_example.png" alt="Mind map example" style="max-width: 500px;">
    </div>
    <p>What you end up with, is a snapshot of your mind. With all the little things connected to each other.</p>
    <div>
        <img src="Mind_map_loop.png" alt="Loop" style="max-width: 500px;">
    </div>
    <p>I tried it one night. The flow went like: (Thing 1) reminds me of (Thing 2) which reminds me of (Thing 3) which reminds me of (Thing 4) which also reminds me of (Thing 2) And hey, these two are related too. *Draws a line joining them*.</p>
    <p>This is what I ended up with:</p>
    <div class="container">
        <div class="image1">
            <img src="my-mind-map2.jpg" alt="Mind Map image" style="max-width: 500px;">
        </div>
        <div class="image2">
          <img src="/images/ghost_heart.png" alt="Bow ghost">
        </div>
      </div>
    <br>
    <!-- <img src="my_mind_map.jpg" alt="Mind Map image" style="max-width: 500px;"> -->

    What I like about this method is:
    <ul>
        <li><p>I get a snapshot of my mind at certain moments in time. -- which is great for journaling!</p></li>
        <li><p>I can look at my thoughts clearly on paper. </p></li>
    </ul>
    <hr>
    <p>And, This is also how your brain stores and connects ideas. (Your neurons literally connect to one another, triggering other neurons.) One thought leads to the other and so on.</p>
    <p>When you focus on one aspect of the map (a topic), new boxes (Things to know about) arrive. This is how, (clichÃ© incoming) <b>knowledge compounds</b>.</p>
    <p>And the more bubbles you have, the more hooks you have to hang new information on!</p>
    <p class="quote">ðŸ’¡ The more you know, the more you realize what you donâ€™t know.</p>
    <p>Which makes you humble. Therefore, (clichÃ© alert 2.0) <b>Wise people are humble</b>.</p>
